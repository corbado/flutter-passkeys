### 3. Corbado Auth Firebase

A Flutter package that builds on the corbado_auth and the passkeys package.
It helps you to integrate passkey authentication into your Flutter app that uses Firebase as a backend.

> **Note:** This package is currently broken and will be fixed in the future. There is no specific ETA on when the fix will be available.

#### Features

- allow new users to sign up and log in using passkeys
- allow existing users (that you created with Firebase authentication) to setup a passkey and then log in with it
- email OTP codes as fallback mechanism for situations when passkeys can not be used (e.g. when a user logs in to a device where none of his passkeys is available)
