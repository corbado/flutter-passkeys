# Corbado Auth for Flutter

## Getting started
A Flutter package to enable authentication through passkeys.
Setting up passkey authentication requires you to have a backend that can act as a relying party.
As this is quite a bit of work the Corbado team is at your service.
You can set up your relying party server just by creating and configuring your free Corbado project.
The Corbado Auth package helps you to integrate your app after you have set up your Corbado project.

This package offers the following functionalities:
- keeping a user logged in even if he closes the app 
- continuously updating a user's tokens (by default their lifetime is limited to 5 minutes)
