# passkeys_example

This example demonstrates how to use the *passkeys* package.
We built it in a way to make it as easy to run as possible.

Therefore, we have set up a pre-configured instance of the relying party server using a [Corbado](https://app.corbado.com) project.

The great thing about this is that you don't need to set up or configure a backend to run the example.
Note, that you share this relying party server with all other users of the *passkeys* package that also run the example though.
Therefore, we clear user data nightly.
